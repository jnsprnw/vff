# Vis for Future Competition

From 20â€“27 September 2019, millions of people worldwide joined the young climate protesters in a [global climate strike](https://globalclimatestrike.net) to fight for climate justice. To support their cause, we carried out an international competition to gather state-of-the-art visualizations of climate change that were created in the last three years. The winners have been selected by an international jury of climate scientists, communicators, and activists. You can find with all other qualifying submissions including infographics, animations, and interactive visualizations below.
